## IDEAS

Dani

- [ ] snakemake script for analysis 


## PROGRESS 

* 1000 functional sequences 

* 2024/04/05: Divided sequence-processing.sh script into 3 (one for each type of RNA) so they can be run in parallel. 

* 2024/04/05: Short-ncRNA dataset had many repeated sequences due to duplicated, but different ID, sequences in RNAcentral dataset --> Removed them from RNAcentral dataset and extracted new sequences
