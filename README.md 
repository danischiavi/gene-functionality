# FEATURES OF FUNCTIONAL HUMAN GENES

 This is the repository for the "Features of Functional Human Genes" paper pipeline, data and results.

## Simple Access Instructions

To access the project, create a local project directory. For example:

    mkdir gene-functionality 

Clone this repository to the project directory.

    git clone https://github.com/danischiavi/gene-functionality gene-functionality

This will download the project pipline and curated paper data and results. The data and results corresponding to the paper are located in the XXX directory.

If you want to use any of the scripts, you will need to perform further installation steps.



## Dependencies

Most dependencies have been set in the conda environemnt YML file.

Create a new conda environment using the YML file loated in the scripts directory.

    conda env create -f condaEnv.yml

Some software was unavailable for adding to the conda environment and will need to be installed/downloaded manually into the **./bin** project directory

## Pipeline Purpose

This pipeline has been created to evaluate XXX. For the research paper that is relevant to this pipeline, please see: XXX


## How to use this pipeline

When running the pipeline, always run from the **project directory**, unless otherwise specified.

1) Download required Databases as descripted in [data/README-data.md file](LINK)  

2) Generate functional and negative control databases following the [Snakefile-sequences file](LINK).For this, run the following command on the Working directory of the project replacing "cores" for the number of cores you want to use  

        snakemake -s Snakefile-sequences -j "cores" 

3) Obtain features for each dataset following [Snakefile-features file](LINK). For this, run the following command on the Working directory of the project replacing "cores" for the number of cores you want to use  

        snakemake -s Snakefile-features -j "cores"

4) Analyze results with [scripts/spearman-function-feature.R](link) and [scripts/random-forest-analysis.R](link) for the main analysis. For complementary analysis see the [complementary directory](link)


## Brief description of scripts

* #### A0-protein-coding-sequences.sh

* #### A1-lncRNA-sequences.sh

* #### A2-short-ncRNA-sequences.sh

* #### A3-negative-control.sh 

* #### B0-intrinsic-seq-features.sh

Calculates the percentage of G+C content of each sequence, counting the number of each nucleotide. 

* #### B1-seq-conservation-features.sh

Extracts the maximum PhyloP and PhastCons conservation scores for each sequence. These scores are extracted from Zoonomia resources. 

* #### B2-transcriptome-expression-features.sh

Calculates the RPKM for each sequence. For this, the reads and total reads of small RNA-Seq datasetsfrom 71 human tissue and 140 human primary-cell samples were obtained from ENCODE. 

* #### B3-genomic-repeats-associated-features.sh

Calculates the genomic copy number of each sequence on the human genome version GRCh38. Also, calculates the distance to the closest non-overlapping transposable DNA elements in the human genome obtained from Dfam vxxx.

* #### B4-protein-and-rna-specific-features.sh

Calculates coding potential using RNAcode based on a multiple sequence alignment 241way from Zoonomia resoures.  

Calculates maximum covariance score to analyse the structure. Also, calculates the Minumum Free Energy.  

Calculates the average interaction free energy between the sequences and a curated database of 34 human ncRNA sequences from RNAcentral v15

* #### B5-population-variation-features.sh

Calculates Minor Allele Frequency (MAF) and the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) density. For this, the SNPs count for each sequence is extracted from gnomAD v3 database. 


* #### C0-spearman-function-feature.R

Calculates a Spearman correlation between each feature and functionality. The correlation matrix for each dataset is generated with the confidence intervals calculated using a bootstrap approach (N=1,000).

* #### C1-random-forest-analysis.R

Generates a Random forests with 1,000 trees, using 70% training data and 30% test data. A bootstrap approach is used to simulate a further 100 classification models to assess performance variation due to sampling biases. 

#### Others 

* B4.1-maf-to-stk.sh

    Converts multiple sequence alignment MAF files to Stockholm. This is used withing the protein-and-rna-specific-features.sh script.
