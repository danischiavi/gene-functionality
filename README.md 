# FEATURES OF FUNCTIONAL HUMAN GENES

 This is the repository for the "Features of Functional Human Genes" paper pipeline, data and results.

## Simple Access Instructions

To access the project, create a local project directory. For example:

    mkdir gene-functionality 

Clone this repository to the project directory.

    git clone https://github.com/danischiavi/gene-functionality gene-functionality

This will download the project pipline and curated paper data and results. The data and results corresponding to the paper are located in the XXX directory.

If you want to use any of the scripts, you will need to perform further installation steps.



## Dependencies



Most dependencies have been set in the conda environemnt YML file.

Create a new conda environment using the YML file loated in the scripts directory.

    conda env create -f condaEnv.yml

Some software was unavailable for adding to the conda environment and will need to be installed/downloaded manually into the features-of-functioanl-human-genes/bin project directory

## Pipeline Purpose



This pipeline has been created to evaluate XXX. For the research paper that is relevant to this pipeline, please see: XXX




## How to use this pipeline



#### The pipeline have the following steps:  

When running the pipeline, always run from the project directory, unless otherwise specified e.g.

1) Download required Databases as descripted in data/README-data.md file 

2) Generate functional and negative control databases following the ./Snakefile-sequences file.
For this, run the following command on the Working directory of the project replacing "cores" for the number of cores you want to use  

        snakemake -s Snakefile-sequences -j "cores" 

3) Obtain features for each dataset following ./Snakefile-features
For this, run the following command on the Working directory of the project replacing "cores" for the number of cores you want to use  

        snakemake -s Snakefile-features -j "cores" 

4) Analyze results with scripts/spearman-function-feature.R and scripts/random-forest-analysis.R for main analysis. 
For complementary analysis see ./complementary directory
